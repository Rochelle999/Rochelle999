## Prepared by: [Rochelle N. Dela Cruz] and [Kisha Jamila P. Braga]


## VULNERABILTY SUMMARY

 #### Outdated Software Versions
 
        * Several systems were found to be running outdated software versions, leaving them susceptible to known vulnerabilities.
        
 #### Weak Password Policies
 
        *Weak password policies were observed, including the use of default or easily guessable passwords.
        
 #### Missing Security Patches
 
        *Critical security patches were missing on multiple servers and workstations, exposing them to known exploits.
        
 #### Unsecured Network Protocols
 
        *Insecure network protocols such as Telnet and FTP were found to be in use, transmitting sensitive information in plaintext.
        
 #### Inadequate Firewall Configurations
 
        *Firewall rules were found to be overly permissive, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive network segments.
        
 #### Lack of Web Application Firewall (WAF)
 
        *Web applications were not protected by a WAF, increasing the risk of SQL injection and other web-based attacks.
        
 #### Insufficient Network Segmentation
 
        *The network lacked proper segmentation, allowing lateral movement within the network in case of a breach.
        
 #### Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
 
        *Several systems were found to be vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to critical resources.
        
 #### Exposed Administrative Interfaces
 
        *Administrative interfaces were accessible from the public internet without adequate authentication mechanisms.
        
 #### Insecure Remote Access
 
        *Remote access tools were configured insecurely, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to internal systems.
        
 #### Lack of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
 
        *An IDS was not deployed, making it difficult to detect and respond to intrusions in real-time.
        
 #### Insecure Wireless Network Configurations
 
        *Wireless networks were configured with weak encryption and lacked proper authentication mechanisms.
        
 #### Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
 
        *Logging and monitoring mechanisms were insufficient to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
        
 #### Use of Deprecated Encryption Algorithms
 
        *Deprecated encryption algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1 were found to be in use, posing a risk to data confidentiality.
        
 #### Default System Configurations
 
        *Some systems were found to be running with default configurations, making them easy targets for attackers.

   ## Conclusion

        *Addressing the vulnerabilities identified in this assessment is crucial for enhancing the security posture of [Google]'s network and systems. By implementing the recommended remediation measures, [Google] can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access. Regular security assessments and proactive security measures are essential for maintaining a robust and resilient security posture in today's threat landscape.























## Conclusion
    * The ethical hacking assessment identified several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities within [Google]'s network infrastructure, applications, and systems. Immediate action is required to remediate these issues and enhance the overall security posture. Implementing the provided recommendations will significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and improve the organization's security defenses.
